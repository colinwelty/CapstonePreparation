Good Afternoon!

This is my readme file for my Capstone Preparation Project for METR3334! This GitHub website is a little rough around the edges, but there 
are a few things included on this repository that should be beneficial.

I've included both working code and non-working code to show the transparency behind coding. The working code will have a "NW" tag at the end of each file
to help differentiate between code that produces something and code that doesn't.

I've included some other code files as well that help display things I've learned during this class!

Thank you for viewing!
