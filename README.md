Good Afternoon!

This is my readme file for my Capstone Preparation Project for METR3334! This GitHub website is a little rough around the edges, but there 
are a few things included on this repository that should be beneficial.

I've included both working code and non-working code to show the transparency behind coding. The working code will have a "NW" tag at the end of each file
to help differentiate between code that produces something and code that doesn't.

I've included some other code files as well that help display things I've learned during this class!

Here are some more details about each file:

"degreeday.py": This is a Python script I wrote this semester at the Mesonet to help diagnose a customer issue with a product that was no
longer operationally supported. Using techniques I learned from METR 3334 and certain online programming tools (such as pulling data from a website),
I was able to generate a working model for Degree Day Heat Unit calculation for a specific Pecan Nut Casebearer Pest Control Model.

"april14assign1.py" and "april14assign2.py": These are the two Python scripts used to reproduce a figure from (Jones et al. 2019) for Homework #3 in METR 3334. Both python files are variations of each other to reproduce similar figures. The goal was to have this in one file and create subplots but that proved to be more challenging, so two separate files were made.

Thank you for viewing!
